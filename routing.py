"""
Provides core functions for grid generation, population creation, and route evaluation
used in vehicle routing optimization problems.

This module defines functions to:
- Generate a 2D grid of randomly placed points.
- Create a population of random routes (permutations of the points).
- Evaluate the total distance of a route based on a distance matrix.
