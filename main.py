"""
Main script file, the project should be run from this file.

Creates a 2D grid with N points with random coordinates, simulating collection locations 
for the vehicle routing problem. The points are uniformly distributed within a defined 
range (e.g., 0 to 100 on both axes), and their pairwise distances are used to construct 
a distance matrix for optimization algorithms.
